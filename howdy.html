<h1> Howdy! </h1>
I do not have a good answer with respect to spoken usage but I decided to try and find out about the usage of "Howdy" using <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams">Google Ngrams</a>. I hope this provides insights into its popularity.

<p>The overall trend can be seen here.</p>

<p>As the usage percentages show, it is not a very common word. To further support this, we compare <i>Howdy</i> with other greetings.</p>

<p> Indeed, <i>Howdy</i> pales in comparison with <i>hi</i> and <i>hello</i>. This agrees with the other answers to this question. Hence, it appears that <i>Howdy</i> is not a word that is widely used. </p>

<h3> Important caveats </h3>
<ul>
	<li> <i> Howdy Doody </i> is a story character that is often referenced in the context of "<i>Howdy</i>". However, it occurs rather infrequently and was therefore ignored in the analysis. </li>
	<li> Audio corpora may provide a more meaningful analysis in the context of the question. <br> The results may have limited validity.</li>
</ul>
