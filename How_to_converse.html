<li><strong> Inverted pyramid</strong> The rule of thumb on asking questions is to go from general to specific, as if you're climbing a pyramid. Start with general questions. This will allow the respondent to veer the conversation to whatever he wants to talk about.  For eg. "Do you like travelling?"
</li>
<li><strong> Track the track</strong> Now if the person just says "No" then you're not asking the right question. You got to change your track. Try different subjects but, again, leave the questions broad. 
</li>

<li> <strong>Find a peg</strong> Latch on to the aspect the person talks most about, and frame your next question around that: For instance, if he mentions he's been all over Europe but starts elaborating on Italy, ask: "Did you try the pizza there?" and chances are he'll start describing the pizzas he had. That should be fun. If not, ask something else. 
</li>
<li> <strong>Make him trust you</strong> It is also very, very important to gain the trust of the person you're speaking to. Else they won't open up. Why should a stranger tell you about the pizzas he ate unless he thinks you are genuinely interested in it? Maintain eye contact and let your face tell him that his story is engaging you. Look interested. 
</li>
<li><strong>Contribute</strong> You also have to contribute to the story. And not just with "aha" and "really?" It helps to know something about everything so you if you know a thing or two about pizza, you can pitch in and enrich the conversation.
</li>
</ol>

You see, we all have stories we want to share, but no one has the time or interest to listen. Just consider the number of answers we all write on Quora and how few of them get read by more than 50 people :(

Above all, have an open mind and be curious to know more about others' works, hobbies or philosophies. Even if you do not agree with them, they will teach you something. In fact everyone we ever interact with knows something more than us, in some field or the other. And if we can get them to share it with us, it is we who gain.

I have talked in-depth with bus conductors, freedom fighters, garbage collectors, singers, actors, priests, pastors, chefs, cops, doctors, gardeners and every time I have gone back with cartloads of interesting personal stories.

And just in case you're wondering why I talk to so many people, I'm a journalist. I ask questions for a living :)
