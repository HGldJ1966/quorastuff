<p>
Oh, yes, the pure land. The vast, loving intelligence in which all individuals I'd ever known or would know were individually recognizable and simultaneously unified as one, and in which all questions, millions at once, were answered instantaneously. That is real. We are born in the heart of God, we return to the heart of God, and the illusion that we ever leave the heart of God is just that: a powerful illusion.
